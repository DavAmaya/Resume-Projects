% Project - CSC429/629 Fall 2023 - Points: 10
% Due: 12:30 PM, Nov 14
% Lateness penalty: -2 per day 

% This is a 1 or 2 person assignment. Type your name(s) below:
% 1.
% 2.
% If 2 persons work on this, both of you should submit a 
% duplicate copy on Canvas under each of your names.
% You may not collaborate with anyone except your partner.
% By submitting this assignment, you implicitly agree to abide
% by the Computer Science Department Academic Integrity Policy.

% DO NOT USE THESE PROLOG FEATURES IN THIS ASSIGNMENT!! YOU
% WILL NOT RECEIVE CREDIT FOR A SOLUTION CONTAINING THESE: 
% ";", "->". Do not use "assert" in the part of the program
% that uses the BN; "assert" should be used only to assert
% facts used by the forward chaining rules.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% What to turn in:
%    Submit a copy of your program on Canvas named project.txt.
%    The digital copy will be used in case the grader needs to 
%    run your program to verify that it works, and to determine 
%    the submission time if late.  Each student on a team should
%    submit a duplicate copy on Canvas under his/her own name.
%    (Include screen shots with your Design Document.)

% Problem: For a detailed description of the project requirements
% see the project document on Canvas. 
  
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Edit this file - add your solution to the steps below.
% Make your solution readable using indentation and white
% space. Do not use a line length that will wrap when printed.
% To run this file, rename it with a .pl extension if your are
% using SWI Prolog, or the proper extension for whatever Prolog
% you are using - you may use any standard Prolog interpreter.
% Follow these instructions for running HW5: 
%   1. Copy fig15_11_mod.pl (my mod of Bratko's BN interpreter) 
%      from Canvas to your computer.
%   2. Copy fig15_7_mod_1.6.17.pl (my version of Bratko's FC rule
%      interpreter) from Canvas to your computer.  
%   3. Start Prolog on your program. Before running your 
%      program, tell Prolog to consult fig15_11_mod.pl and
%      fig15_7_mod_1.6.17.pl (in SWI Prolog, you would use menu 
%      commands: Filemenu -> Consult -> ... )
%   4. Warning: if you run the FC rules more than once, 
%      retract the facts, or just QUIT prolog and start
%      over to flush the facts from memory. 

%% HW2&3 Directives (must be at top of SWI Prolog program)
%  Syntax may differ in other Prolog interpreters. 
:- dynamic fact/1.
:- dynamic p/2.
:- dynamic p/3.

% Operator definitions for forward chaining if-then rules.
:- op(800,fx,if).
:- op(700,xfx,then).
:- op(300,xfy,or).
:- op(200,xfy,and).

% Step 1:  Define the BN graph using the syntax required by
% Bratko's BN interpreter as in HW3.



% Step 2: Define the BN prior probabilities here as in HW3



% Step 3: Define BN conditional probability tables here as in HW3




% Step 4:  Define FC rules here as in HW2:



% Step 5:  Implement the main program recommend here
